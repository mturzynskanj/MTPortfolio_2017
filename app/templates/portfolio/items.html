<h2> PORTFOLIO</h2>
<br />
<p>During my career I participated in a development of many sites. <br />
    Below, I present a few recent one.
    The skills that I had to utilize vary for different projects.<br />
    However, my attitude was always the same: trying to provide the best product for the end user.
