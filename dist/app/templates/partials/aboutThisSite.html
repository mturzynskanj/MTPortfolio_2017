<h2>About this site </h2>
<ul>
    <strong>This site was created using following technologies:</strong>
    <li>
        1. Grunt
        <p class="alt1">
            To structure and build the project I used Grunt and Bower tools.
            I utilized grunt watch, sass, connect, and uglify modules.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>2. Require, Backbone Layout Manager, and Underscore
        <p class="alt1">
         This website is implemented as a Single Page Application. <br />
          Javascript files are structured as modules and html is rendered based on
          underscore templates.
          Data is provided to the page as a an array of json objects.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>2. Sass
        <p class="alt1">
            For styling and visual effects I used Sass preprocessor.
            I created multiple sass mixin functions that I repeatedly used  to
            implement animations and transitions.
